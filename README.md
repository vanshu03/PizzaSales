# Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This repository contains the **Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard**, a comprehensive data visualization project developed using **Power BI**. The dashboard provides valuable insights into sales trends, customer preferences, and product performance for a fictional pizza business. It is designed to assist in data-driven decision-making and operational optimization.

## Features

  - Used Power Query in Power BI to clean and preprocess the raw dataset.
  - Handled null values, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.

- **Data Modeling**:
  - Established relationships between tables for efficient querying.
  - Defined calculated columns and measures using DAX (e.g., Total Revenue, Average Order Value).

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - Designed a visually appealing, user-friendly layout.
  - Incorporated slicers for filtering by pizza category and other dimensions.
  - Created visuals including bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts.
